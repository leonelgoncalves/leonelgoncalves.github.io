Planning has always been an important part in every aspect of life. In business, knowing which, how and for when tasks need be done is crucial. But like everything, planning needs the right amount of flexibility and rigidity. The issue is that in most cases we don't know when to be flexible and when do we need to put our feet down, nor we know the impact we can cause if we pick the wrong choice.

## The current state of planning

Ever since the boom of the agile methodologies, most companies incorporate them in their projects, and names like Scrum, Kanban and others became popular. Now almost all software companies apply Scrum (or they say they do) which in some way is good because even when most companies don’t do it the right way, at least they are trying. But there’s a downside… when these methodologies are not applied the right way, the results are not as expected, therefore we have delays, bad quality, unhappy employees and frustrated clients or stakeholders.

In my experience, the most common error among companies is the way the projects are planned. Almost all companies think that the project manager is the sole and only responsible for estimating. So this person is responsible for creating the entire task list, saying in how much time these activities should by done and creating the project
plan, and is exactly here where everything falls. Because even the right person at the right job at the right place can make wrong decisions –if that person decides alone. This is caused by the way the human cognition works, as Finkelstein and his coauthors stated in [2009](https://goo.gl/YsaKPE).

So, what is the best way to plan a project?

## Focus on planning and not on the plan

As Mike Cohn said in [Agile Estimating and Planning](https://goo.gl/rD33Gh), ***“the knowledge and insight we gain from planning persist long after the plan”***. The most important part on doing a project’s plan is the process. How many times have you been working in a project in which the client has not changed his mind about a feature, or wanted a feature removed? This is the main reason why the waterfall model failed; the project scope is not set in stone, functionalities changes, what we think is useful now might not be useful in a month, and this is great! It’s what makes projects successful, is better to change remove or add a feature while in development than deliver a useless one.

Focusing on the planning not only allow us to be more flexible, it also creates the feeling of ownership with the project, it allows to create a connection with the project, and while this may sound silly, the more we manage to create a connection between the people and the work they do, the more productive they are going to be. Which brings me to the next point.

## Planning is a group activity

I once worked in a project that had 3 leaders (back-end, front-end and mobile), and once I was discussing an issue with mine and he told me ***“Let me write this down because I have the planning session in an hour and I’ll discuss it with the others leaders”***. The next day they came with the plan for the next month, this plan took them 3 hours of closed door discussion. After each leader discussed the planning with their respective teams, at least half of the tasks were changed… After that, the team was talking about how the team the leaders meeting was a huge waste of time and how being a leader is the most overrated job, without mentioning that the commitment with the project was below ground level…

If instead of doing the planning closed doors they would have invited for all the teams to be there (10 people total), those 3 hours would have been saved, the team would have felt empowered because their opinion was taken into account and the company would have saved at least $2000 on wasted time.

So next time you need to create a plan for a new project think about this. Remember that the road is more important than the goal, that all the team members can provide something ([as I said in a previous post](https://goo.gl/iHmBqp)) and that even the best plan needs to be revised regularly **BY THE WHOLE TEAM!**.
