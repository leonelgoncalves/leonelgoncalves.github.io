There are many books about leadership, how to make happy employees and why companies should make an effort to have happy employees and so on. However, there are not many books or articles on how to make happy managers, happy stakeholders and happy clients. So I decided talk about it and say what, in my experience, is the key to success in this areas.

## Invest in good managers.

Most companies have 2 types of managers, the "9 women can deliver a baby one month" type and the "I have no idea so let's put some extra padding" type. Both types are equally bad and they will cause unnecessary expenses and stress, so let’s talk about them little more.

### The "9 women can deliver a baby one month" type
In my opinion, this type of manager is more dangerous than the second type. Why? Because they create false expectations to stakeholders and usually are very bad when estimating tasks. Not only that, but they also tend to blame the team or the lack of resources when deadlines are not met. 

This type of manager also has another dangerous quality. They tend to be so confident with their knowledge that they tend not to listen their own teams, and this is the source of many of their problems. When a manager does not listen, his team is not going to give 100% percent of their efforts. I’m telling this from my own experience, I used to worked at a company that had managers so good that all of the employees used to work between 1 and 2 extra hours per day for free (including me), sometimes if it was needed we used to stay even more time, asking in exchange just a pizza for fuel at the late hours. An extra hour per day may not sound like too much, but in a project with 5 employees we are talking about 100 more hours per month, so the company was saving around $10000 per month for just being nice, listening and having amazing planning sessions.

### The "I have no idea so let's put some extra padding" type

This type of managers are the complete opposite, they have no idea how to create an estimate and they have near to 0% confidence in themselves, so they let their teams run all the estimations, which in some cases can be dangerous if none of the members know how to do it. This behaviour can harm the relationship with the client or stakeholder, since the projects usually take much more time than they should. 

There’s another quality that can come with this type of manager, and that is self-confidence (yes, I know, the complete opposite to what I said in the beginning, but the origin characteristics make it fall under the same type). In this case since they have no idea what are they’re doing, they just ignore the team, cover his own back and they just say that all the tasks are huge… which in the end it causes unnecessary delays to the project.

## Show how hard is your job.

If more than half of your employees think that they can do a better job than you then you have 2 problems. First, you have so little communication with your team that they think that your job is almost useless, and second, your employees are so poorly motivated that they have the time to think about that.
This can be fixed (or completely avoided) in different ways, the easiest (and my personal favourite) is to engage with you team daily, helping them, even having lunch with them. Talk about your issue, ask about their issues, show them that you are not only their boss but also a person, working in the company just like them. Creating this kind of relation is going to create a bond with the company, and you’ll see that they will stop thinking that they can do a better job and start thinking and how can they help you.

## Learn to say No and to justify your teams work

Most managers are heavily influenced by “the client is always right”. While this is not a complete lie, most people don’t know how to handle clients or stakeholders. They feel that if they reject any petition, challenge them or state a different time frame they will get angry and leave. The truth is, that in most cases the client just wants to know that his money is well invest and that they will see the return of investment sooner than later, but I can guarantee that they will always want for you to be honest. 

What I always say, do you prefer if I lie to you and say that I will have something done in a month and then show up with a bad product or take 1 extra month to deliver, or if I tell you the truth from the beginning and tell you the product is going to be ready in two months?. I bet that you will prefer the truth. And so will all the stakeholders.

So if you want to stop suffering at your management/leadership job, just do these 3 things: 
- Focus on employing the right people
- Be nice and share your problems with your colleagues, and listen to theirs
- Tell the truth

If you think about it, is almost the same recommendation you give to your kids every day. So just do what you hope your kids do.
