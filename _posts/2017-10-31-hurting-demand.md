A little more than half of my professional life I’ve worked for Latin America companies, and regardless the where were their clients located (inside Latin-America, US or Europe) they all had one thing in common, planning, budget and client pressure were a real thing. 
Most of the people I had the opportunity to work with (and with some of them the honour to work with) were really hard working people, in all the sense of the word, they just didn’t work hard but they worked smart, they didn’t just find the solution, but they always tried to find the best solution, even if it take a little more time and effort. 
I also had the great opportunity to work with great project managers and product owners, of those that you think that only exist in books. They were not only among the best PM and PO I’ve meet but also they were among the best developers. Don’t get me wrong, they were really picky with details, I remember once when I was working in a project for the Volkswagen web site, they scolded me because I pushed a style change that consisted in adding one more pixel of padding and in the message I just put “Style fixes”, when I should have been more descriptive. 
But lately I’ve been talking with some friends and we all feel that both, developers and managers, are just worst each day. At least in some markets, I don’t know if this is happening because the demand-offer curve is a little messed up, and companies are being forced to employ anybody, or maybe the requirements are lower now, but this is an actual problem that’s happening. People with less than the necessary knowledge are getting position for which they are not prepared for, and this is affecting the industry.
I would like to put an example, a friend of mine told me a little more than a week ago, that he had a meeting at his new job, here he showed a small end-to-end test, and all the team thought that was “like magic”, this was a little shocking since we used to work together and doing end-to-end testing was part of the everyday, in fact, a task was not complete if that task was not tested (unit, end-to-end and integration). I’ve too seen this, I’ve worked with people that have no idea how to write a test or what a e2e test is.
Some months ago I also have an discussion with one of the developers in my team, I had to configured the deployment of our new application (using a mixture between Nolio, Teamcity and Nexus) because we the guy who received the training to do so didn’t know how to do it (even after the training). When I finally got the deployment configured my colleague came to my desk, congratulates me, and as soon I tried to explain to him what I did for him to be able to do it in the future, he told me that he didn’t care because that was a UI issue. I couldn’t believe that someone could think that way.
I also don’t understand how some managers don’t care about the performance of their team, I’ve worked on teams that couldn’t be able to work for a whole week because the developments environments were down, the only ones trying to fix this was me and the manager from the client side, and this was a team of about 7 people!. We are talking about 200 hours lost with an average salary of around 18 euros per hour we that’s 3600 euros lost (and this is not what is being charge to the client, so the client probably lost at least 5000 euros in just one week). I understand that for a big company this is not a significant amount of money, but if this is happening in all projects (which I’m pretty sure is), then it’s a big issue.
Maybe this is just me ranting, but what I wish companies notice is that, by employing bad developers and managers the company is losing way more money. It’s cheaper and better to have 1 great developer than having 2 or 3 bad ones. It’s cheaper to have a good manager that is able to see when something is not being done than wasting 6 months in a project that is going slower than a turtle. But I guess that most companies don’t care about earning or saving more money. And even the best developers get tired of being ignored and at some point they just do the job for what they are being paid and nothing more or just look for a better job offer… which each day is becoming harder because since most companies prefer having 2 “cheap” developers than one good one… is not that there’s any empirical proof that a good programmer is worth 10 (read Steve McConnell “Making Software: What Really Works, and Why We Believe It“)
