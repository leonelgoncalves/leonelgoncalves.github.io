My name is Leonel Augusto Torrealba Gonçalves, I am a graduate of Computer Engineering with advanced knowledge software development, solid basis in software engineering, training Project Management and lover of agile methodologies. I define myself as a lover of technology and am constantly updating my knowledge of new trends and paradigms in order to always be at the forefront in the field of computing.

My favorite fields are project management, planning and development of software applications of any kind and developing applications using Xscript (I like almost all type of scripting languages but have special love for Javascript (ES5 or ES6) and TypeScript).

If you talk to my friends or my wife, they will tell you I’m a punctuality freak and hopeless perfectionist, and I get mildly frustrated when either a) Everything is done right but the results are not as expected (happens often in the kitchen), or 2) everything is explained properly and thoroughly and still the people listening didn’t fully understand the information provided (Happens more than I would expect). If you are anything like me, you know what I mean with all that fancy talk. This is a character trade that touches every aspect of my life, but seriously, if something is not done with at least the intention of doing it right, why do it at all?

In my spare time I dedicate myself to read, enjoying some of the wonderful european outdoors with my wife and my dog, learn new things and practicing martial arts. I am a fan of cooking, I love good food, Mondays and highly enjoy craft beers.
